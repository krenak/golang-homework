# golang-HomeWork

Repository with a collection of my golang homeworks. It is all based on [Ellen KÃ¶rbes' Golang trainning YouTube series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCKpcjBB_VlBsxJ9IseNxFllf-UFEXOdg).
The series are sectioned into eleven levels, which are called ninja levels. Therefore, each folder represents the actual level and homework development that I am currently in.
Sadly - for some, the series is in portuguese.

## Getting hands dirty
If you are interest in Golang as well as I am and feel like helping, by all means, go for it! All help is more than welcomed here! :)

To do so, it only requires a bit of [Git knowledge](https://git-scm.com/docs) and some few minutes setting up things. Also, highly recommended for those who are not familiar with the Git workflow, [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en) offers a quite comprehensive and well-organized documentation about this versioning tool.

For a quick start, configure your Git credentials locally by typing:

```Git
git config user.name "Your Name"
git config user.email "username@email.com"
```
Then, clone this repo by copy pasting this line - *bare with me, I highly suggest you use SSH to save some valuable time. More info [here](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2018/08/09/keeping-your-account-safe/) or [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) for Github guys.*

```Git
git@gitlab.com:krenak/golang-homework.git
```
Also, to mantain things organized, it's standard procedure to create a branch and work on that:

```Git
git branch new_branch
git checkout -b new_branch
```
Once your clonning and branching are done, head to your (*or ours heheheh*) new cloned directory by typing:
```
cd golang-homework/
```
Now you're in the folder, you can modify any of the files and commit the changes later.
